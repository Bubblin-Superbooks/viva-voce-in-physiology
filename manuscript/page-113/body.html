Systolic Blood pressure increases more than diastolic blood pressure due to decreased distensiblity. Systolic blood pressure is 100+age in years However Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreases after 50-60 years of age Sex: In females, before menopause Systolic Blood Pressure is 4-5 mm Hg less than that in males of same age. After menopause SBP is 4-5 mm Hg more than males of same age. It is due to estrogen hormone which prevents atherosclerosis and is protective. Body built: In obese individuals, the blood pressure gives high reading because there is more tissue present between cuff and artery. Higher pressure is needed to occlude the brachial. Climate: Exposure to cold produces vasoconstriction and increases peripheral resistance via hypothalamus.</p></div> </div>
