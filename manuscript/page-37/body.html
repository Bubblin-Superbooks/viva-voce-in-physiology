   <strong>Que.2. What are Korotkoff’s sounds? How do they differ from heart sounds?</strong>
   <p>Ans 2. Kortokoff’sounds These sounds are produced by the turbulent flow in the artery which can be heard during auscultation distal to obstruction when compression is slowly released. Phase I- Clear, faint, tapping sound for first 10 – 14 mm Hg fall of pressure Phase II- Murmuring or musical quality of sound during next 15-220 mm Hg fall in pressure Phase III- Clear loud sound during the next 5-7 mm Hg fall of pressure Phase IV- Dull and muffled sound for the last 5-6 mm Hg fall of pressure and final the sound disappears They differ from the normal heart sounds in the way they are produced. The first Heart sound is produced due to closure of “AV valves” and marks the onset of ventricular systole. It sounds like the syllable “L-U-B-B” The Second Heart sound is produced due to closure of “semilunar valves” and marks the onset of ventricular diastole. It sounds like “D-U-B-B”</p>
