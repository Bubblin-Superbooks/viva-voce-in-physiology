   <strong>Q3. What is auscultatory gap?</strong>
   <p>Ans 3. Auscultatory gap This gap is seen in hypertensives. It is seen while recording the blood pressure by auscultatory method. In such individuals, occasionally sound may disappear temporarily during phase I and II, covering a range of 40-50 mm Hg pressure and reappear again. The cause of this silent gap is not known.</p>
   <p>This causes the marked underestimation of systolic Blood pressure, if cuff pressure is only raised to a level at which sounds are absent. . One may miss a hypertensive with blood pressure of 220/100 and wrongly record his blood pressure as 130/100 due to this. That is why it is essential to measure palpatory method first. In a camp of 1000 patients where screening is being done and time is limited, it is better to raise the cuff pressure to 220 mmHg to be on the safe side.</p>
