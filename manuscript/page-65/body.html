   <p>Ans 6. The contraction and relaxation periods of the muscle twitch helps in classifying the skeletal muscle as:- Isotonic muscle contraction Isometric muscle contraction Isotonic contraction Isometric contraction When the muscle shortens in length but the tension in the muscle remains constant.</p>

   <p>When the muscle length is not affected but the tension in the muscle changes.</p>
