   <strong>Que.2. How does heart rate and blood pressure vary with exercise and rest? What may be reason for this variation?</strong>
   <p>Ans. The heart rate and blood pressure increases in linearity with exercise due to the following reasons- Increase in sympathetic activity Decrease in vagal tone Increase in body temperature Release of catecholamines and thyroxine into circulation Change in blood chemistry e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia and academia</p>
   <strong>Que. 3.What is postural hypotension?</strong>
   <p>Ans.In this condition, there occurs a fall in blood pressure with sudden change in posture. This is due to autonomic insufficiency. This condition is associated with dizziness, dimness of vision and fainting attacks. In elderly patients who have autonomic failure orthostatic hypotension results. Due to change of posture for example standing suddenly after sleep, attacks of dizziness may result due to peripheral pooling of blood due to gravity. The condition may be diagnosed and monitored by autonomic tilt table testing. The subject is asked to tense and relax his entire body parts the moment he gets up before stepping out of bed.</p>
