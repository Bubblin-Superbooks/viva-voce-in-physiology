<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> BP=CO X PR. Systolic Blood pressure depends on Cardiac output (CO) that increases due to sympathetic activity with increasing intensity of exercise. Diastolic blood pressure increases with peripheral resistance (PR). The lumen size and PR ,varies with opposing forces of sympathetic causing vasoconstriction and accumulation of local vasodilator metabolites during exercise like carbon dioxide, adenosine that causing vasodilation. This explains the variation of diastolic blood pressure in untrained individual with varying grades of exercise In trained individuals the systolic blood pressure increases and diastolic blood pressu0re remains same. Emotions: Excitement, fear, worry increase systolic blood pressure due to increase in cardiac couture secondary to increased sympathetic activity Gravity: The pressure in any vessel below heart level is increased and that above heart level is decreased due to the effect of gravity Hereditary:</p></div> </div>
