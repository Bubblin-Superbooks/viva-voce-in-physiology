It is located on the posterior aspect of the heart at the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) with right atrium (RA). It consists of thin elongated muscle fibers (approximately 1/3RD the size of heart muscle fibers),, rich in glycogen and mitochondria, fusiform in shape with longitudinal striations. These are called P cells or pacemaker cells. These fibers normally can generate and discharge impulses more rapidly than any other pacemaker tissue and their rate of discharge determines the rate at which the heart beats.</p></div> </div>
