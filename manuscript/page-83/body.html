<p>It is the condition in which the load acts on the muscle before it begins to contract.</p>
   <p>The muscle is not stretched by the weight during rest.</p>
   <p>2.It keeps the series elastic component of the muscle stretched. It causes complete contraction of the contractile component.</p>
   <p>3.It causes partial contraction of the contractile component. The performance of the muscle is poor.</p>
   <p>4.The performance of the muscle is better. e.g. movement of the skeletal muscle while lifting the weights e.g. movement of skeletal muscle while carrying the weights.</p>
   <strong>Q.18. What is the effect of load on the latent period of the muscle twitch?</strong>
   <p>Ans 18. 1.The load lengthens the latent period but reduces the contraction and relaxation periods. 2.It also reduces the height of the contraction so that the graph may be obtained on the drum.</p>
