   <p>Ans. 1gm/dL haemoglobin, when fully saturated, combines with 1.34 ml of oxygen, therefore haemoglobin concentration is an index of oxygen carrying capacity of blood. Normal values:- Males- 21ml/dL Females- 18ml/dL Adult Haemoglobin [HbA] Fetal Haemoglobin [HbF] 1.Contains 4 polypeptide chains [2 alpha and 2 beta].</p>

   <ol>
      <li>Appears in red cells of fetus in 5th month. At birth, 20% of total Hb is HbA.</li>
      <li>Life span is long- 120 days.</li>
      <li>
         It has usual affinity for oxygen.
      </li>
      <li>
         Percentage saturation at pO2 of 20mmHg = 30-35%
      </li>
      <li>The 2 beta chains are replaced by gamma chains.</li>
      <li>HbF at birth makes up 80% of total Hb; disappears by 5th month after birth.</li>
      <li>Life span is short- about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>It has greater affinity for oxygen as it binds 2,3 DPG less avidly.</li>
      <li>Percentage saturation at pO2 of 20mmHg = 70%</li>
