<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ans. The factors affecting the sedimentation process are:- Rouleaux formation- by increasing density and decreasing the surface area increases the settling of RBCs. Viscosity of plasma:- if increases, settling decreases [viscosity of water: plasma: blood:: 1:3:5] Ratio of cells to plasma [normal- 45:55], if alters as in anemia, increases the rouleaux formation, hence settling of RBCs. Nature of anticoagulant used:- Liquid anticoagulants by altering cell-plasma ratio, increases the ESR.</p></div> </div>
