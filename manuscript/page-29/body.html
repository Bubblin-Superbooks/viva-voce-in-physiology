	   <strong>Que.3. Why MCHC cannot be greater than the normal value?</strong>
   <p>Ans. MCHC values never exceed 38% because RBCs cannot hold haemoglobin beyond its saturation point i.e. metabolic limit of the cells haemoglobin forming mechanism, therefore, anemia can never be hyperchromic.</p>


   <h4>RBC COUNT:-</h4>
   <strong>Que.1. What is the normal RBC count?</strong>
   <p>Ans. The normal values of RBC count are:- 
   	<ul>
   		<li>At birth- 6-7 million/µL</li>
   		<li>Adults- Males- 5-6 million/µL [average 5.5 million/µL]</li>
   		<li>Females- 4.5-5.5 million/µL [average 4.8million/µL]</li>
   	</ul>
   </p>
   <strong>Que.2. What is the clinical importance? What are the conditions in which the RBC count decreases or increase?</strong>
   <p>Ans. <strong> Clinical importance: </strong>

   It is taken as a part of complete blood count [CBC]. It can provide useful information in cases of anemia. </p>
