Electrocardiogram- The record of the electrical changes during the cardiac cycle is called Electrocardiogram (ECG) Electrocardiography-It refers to the basis of recording of ECG. The two methods are employed for its recoding-unipolar and bipolar. In unipolar method, ECG is recorded using one active exploring electrode while in bipolar method; ECG is recorded using two active exploring electrodes. Electrocardiograph-It refers to an instrument for making permanent record of small potential variations which occur in different parts of the body due to the electrical activity of the heart.</p></div> </div>
