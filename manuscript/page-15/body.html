      <ul>
         <li>Stage 1 of about 10 min during which time rouleaux formation [piling of RBCs] occurs and aggregation occurs.</li>
         <li>Stage 2 of approximately 40 min in which the sinking of the aggregates takes place at a constant speed. </li>
         <li>Stage 3 of 10 min during which aggregated cells pack at the bottom of the tube.</li>
         
      </ul>

   <strong>Que3. Give the variations of ESR?</strong>
   <p>Ans. Physiological variations:-</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Age:- Lowest value in new born because RBC count is more.</li>
      <li>Sex :- Higher value in females due to low RBCs coun t</li>
      <li>Pregnancy:- ESR increases as fibrinogen increases during pregnancy; this increases the rouleaux formation.</li>
      <li>Temperature :- ESR values are directly propotional to the temperature within the physiological limits. It acts by decreasing the blood viscosity.</li>

      <li>Pathological variations:-</li>

  </ul>
