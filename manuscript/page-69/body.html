<strong>Q.7. Temperature affects isotonic and isometric contraction differently. Explain.</strong>
   <p>Ans. 7. Cold ringer solution decreases the temperature of the muscle, thereby increases the viscosity and retarding some metabolic processes. Hence depolarisation is slow, thereby resulting in the decreased velocity of response. Warm ringer solution increases the temperature of the muscle, thereby reducing its inertia and the synaptic delays are minimised.</p>
   <strong>Q.8. Which type of summation has been demonstrated to you: spatial or temporal?</strong>
   <p>Ans 8. Temporal summation</p>
   <strong>Q.9. Is the summation of muscle contraction associated with the summation underlying electrical events? Suggest an experiment that will give an answer to this Q.tion.</strong>
