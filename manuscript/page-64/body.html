	<p> Therefore QRS deflection in VF will be the same as seen in leads V3 and V4 i.e. predominantly biphasic VL reflects the electrical activity of the left outer side of the heart, therefore, QRS deflection in VL will be the same as seen in lead V6 i.e. predominantly positive VR reflects the electrical activity of the cavity of the ventricles, whatever may be the position of the heart. Thus, the P wave, QRS complex and T wave are negative waves.</p>

   <strong>Que. 7. What is the pacemaker of the heart?</strong>
   <p>Ans 7. The SA Node (Sino atrial node) is known as the pacemaker of the heart. It is located on the posterior aspect of the heart at the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) with right atrium (RA). It consists of thin elongated muscle fibers (approximately one third the size of heart muscle fibers), rich in glycogen and mitochondria, fusiform in shape with longitudinal striations. These are called P cells or pacemaker cells. These fibers normally can generate and discharge impulses more rapidly than any other pacemaker tissue and their rate of discharge determines the rate at which the heart beats.</p>
