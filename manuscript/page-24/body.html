   <strong>Que.3. List the physiological and pathological variations in the number of WBCs.</strong>
   <p>Ans. <strong>Physiological leucocytosis: </strong><p>
   	<p>
   		<strong>Normal infants-</strong>
   	 The count may be as high as 18,000-20,000/mm3 but it returns to normal values within 1-2 years. </p>

  	<p><strong>Food intake and digestion or Physical exercise : </strong> 

  		There is a mild increase which returns to normal within an hour or so. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		<strong>
  		Mental stress, Pregnancy
  		</strong>
  		- The count may be quite high, especially during the first pregnancy. 	
  	</p>
  		<strong>Parturition</strong>-
  		 The high TLC is possibly due to tissue injury, pain, physical stress and hemorrhage.  <p>
  		 	<p>
  		 		<strong>Extreme temperature</strong> - Exposure to sun, or to very low temperature can increase the WBC count.
  		 	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Pathological leucocytosis:</strong>
		- Acute infection with pyogenic [pus forming] bacteria.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Myocardial infarction</strong>
		- The rise in TLC due to tissue injury is not seen immediately after a heart attack but only after 4-5 days.
