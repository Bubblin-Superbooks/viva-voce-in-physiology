<p>It is also known as anaerobic pneumonia.</p>

<strong>Q.3. What is breaking point? Why is it caused?</strong>
   <p>Ans 3.The breaking point refers to the point at which breathing can no longer be voluntarily inhibited. It is due to the following reasons- Increased arterial pCO2 Increased arterial pO2</p>
   <strong>Q. 4. Why the person may feel dizzy after 15 to 30 seconds of hyperventilation?</strong>
   <p>Ans 4.When a person hyperventilates for 15-30 second and then steps and allows respiration to continue on its own, without exerting any control over it, there is a short period of apnea. This is followed by a few breaths and then a period of apnea once again, followed by a few breaths. The cycle may last for a while before returning to normal rhythm. The apnea is due to washing out of pCO2 (hypocapnia), but as CO 2 accumulates the breath starts again. Wash out carbon dioxide causes cerebral vasoconstriction and person may feel dizzy.</p>
