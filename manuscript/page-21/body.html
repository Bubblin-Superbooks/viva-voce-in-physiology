<p>Ans. The white blood corpuscles [WBCs; leucocytes] constitute the major defense system of the body against invasion by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins and other foreign invades. Their number increases or decreases in many diseases, particularly acute and chronic infections. This test is done as a part of CBC [Complete blood count] in cases of fever especially if the cause of fever is not immediately apparent.</p>
   <strong>Que.3. List the physiological and pathological variations in the number of WBCs.</strong>
   <p>Ans. -Physiological leucocytosis:- Normal infants- The count may be as high as 18,000-20,000/mm3 but it returns to normal values within 1-2 years. Food intake and digestion- There is a mild increase which returns to normal within an hour or so. Physical exercise Mental stress Pregnancy- The count may be quite high, especially during the first pregnancy. Parturition- The high TLC is possibly due to tissue injury, pain, physical stress and hemorrhage. Extremes of temperature- Exposure to sun, or to very low temperature can increase the WBC count.</p>
