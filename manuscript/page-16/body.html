      <li>Increase in ESR is seen in condition which is associated with tissue damage or inflammation, the common conditions being:</li>
      <li>Anemia</li>
      <li>Any toxic or infective condition</li>
      <li>Malignancies</li>
	
      <li>Nephrosis as it is associated with increased fibrinogen, markedly decreased albumin and marked lipidemia which increases the globulin.</li>
      <li>Severe trauma</li>
      <li>Decrease in ESR value is found in:</li>
      <li>Polycythemia</li>
      <li>Leukemia</li>
      <li>Pernicious anemia</li>
      <li>Congestive heart failure</li>
      <li>Protein shock e.g. burns, dehydration</li>
      <li>Severe allergic reactions.</li>
