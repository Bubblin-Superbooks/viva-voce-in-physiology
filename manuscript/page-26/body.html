   <strong>Que.3. Why a dilution of 200 times is needed in the case of total RBC count?</strong>
   <p>Ans. A high dilution is needed because the number of RBCs is very high.</p>
   <strong>Que.4. What are the other uses of RBC pipette and Neubauer chamber?</strong>
   <p>Ans. RBC pipette:- i) Sperm count ii) Platelets count iii) WBC count [when WBCs increase tremendously as in leukemias] Neubauer chamber: - Total Leucocyte Count [TLC]</p>
   <strong>Que.5. What are the various sources of error in this experiment?</strong>
   <p>Ans. This method is subjected to many errors, briefly these are; Pipette error:- Inaccuracy in the calibration Inaccuracy in measuring the blood sample and the diluting fluid. Field error:- Unequal distribution of cells over the grid caused by:- Under or overcharging of the chamber. Presence of grease on slide or cover slip. Personal error:- Counting fewer cells than are actually present [due to inexperience] Statistical error:- It is inversely propotional to the square root of the number counted.</p>
