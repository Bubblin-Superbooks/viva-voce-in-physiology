<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> VF reflects the electrical activity of the inferior surface of the heart this may be formed in both right and left ventricles; therefore QRS deflection in VF will be the same as seen in leads V3 and V4 i.e. predominantly biphasic VL reflects the electrical activity of the left outer side of the heart, therefore, QRS deflection in VL will be the same as seen in lead V6 i.e. predominantly positive VR reflects the electrical activity of the cavity of the ventricles, whatever may be the position of the heart. Thus, the P wave, QRS complex and T wave are negative waves.</p></div> </div>
