   	<p> <strong> Electrocardiograph: </strong> It refers to an instrument for making permanent record of small potential variations which occur in different parts of the body due to the electrical activity of the heart.</p>

	   <strong>Q.2 Why is it necessary to have recording of 12 leads in electrocardiography? State the placement of electrodes in different lead systems.</strong>

   <p>Ans 2. The 12 leads in ECG can be compared to 12 men standing on 12 hill tops observing an event of spread of a forest fire. </p>


<p> The orientation of each lead views the spread of electrical activity in two planes frontal plane and horizontal plane. Frontal plane leads The six limb leads (I,II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) These limb leads view the heart in a vertical or frontal plane. These leads record the electrical activity of the heart moving up and down and left and right across the heart. aVR is oriented to the cavities of the heart I and aVL view the left ventricles.</p>
<p> 
 They are called left lateral leads. II, III and aVF view inferior heart surface which rests on the diaphragm. They are called inferior leads. An imaginary line joining the positive and negative electrode of a lead is called “axis of the lead”. It measures the angle of orientation of the lead and is expressed in degrees. Horizontal Plane Leads</p>
