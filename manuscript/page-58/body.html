<strong>Q.1. Describe the record obtained during coughing, sneezing and speech. What is the mechanism? How these reflexes are helpful for the body?</strong>
   <p>Ans 1. i. Both coughing and sneezing begin with a deep inspiration followed by forceful expiration; however, in sneezing expiration is a continuous process. ii. Effect of talking- In the expiratory phase, there is a staircase pattern because all syllables are formed in this phase.</p>
   <strong>Q. 2. What is deglutition apnea? What are the neural pathways involved in this mechanism? How may this be useful for the body? What is aspiration pneumonia?</strong>
   <p>Ans 2.During a swallowing movement, respiration gets inhibited in whatever stage of the cycle the swallowing was initiated. This is called deglutition apnea. The afferent impulses travel in glossopharyngeal nerve that inhibits respiratory centre. The reflex is protective in nature and prevents the aspiration of food particles into respiratory passage. Aspiration pneumonia is an inflammation of lungs and bronchial tubes that occur after inhalation of any foreign matter. </p>
