   <strong>Que.4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Sahliâ€™s method?</strong>
   <p>Ans. Advantages:- The advantage of using this method is its relative ease with which the brown colour of acid haematin can be compared with the comparator box standard colour optically, otherwise it is difficult to note the precision of the colour of acid haematin so formed. Disadvantages:- The disadvantage of this method is that it is tedious and time consuming to perform, especially with large number of samples. It is also not accurate as the relative marks on the haemoglobinometer are taken as standard ones and the hemoglobin is thus calculated with its help.</p>
   <strong>Que.5. Can N/10 HCl be used instead of distilled water for dilution and why?</strong>
   <p>Ans. Yes, N/10 HCl can be used for dilution instead of distilled water as the standard colour of acid haematin needed for comparison corresponds to the N/10 HCl.</p>
