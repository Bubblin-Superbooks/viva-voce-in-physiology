   <ol>
      <li>Improper labeling of the slides.</li>
      <li>Intermixing of the four drops placed on the slide.</li>
      <li>Examining the agglutination after drying up of solution.</li>
      <li>Directly mixing of undiluted blood with antisera.</li>
   </ol>
   <strong>Que.4. What are the differences between coagulation, rouleaux formation and agglutination?</strong>
   <p>Ans. Coagulation:- It is the process by which blood changes from a liquid to a gel, forming a clot. It potentially results in hemostasis, the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel, followed by repair. Rauleaux formation:- It refers to the piling of the RBCs one over the other. Agglutination:- It refers to the clumping of the RBCs. The phenomenon of agglutination is due to the interaction between the factors- antigen and antibody.</p>
