	   <strong>Q. 2. What is deglutition apnea? What are the neural pathways involved in this mechanism? How may this be useful for the body? What is aspiration pneumonia?</strong>
   <p>Ans 2.During a swallowing movement, respiration gets inhibited in whatever stage of the cycle the swallowing was initiated. This is called deglutition apnea. The afferent impulses travel in glossopharyngeal nerve that inhibits respiratory centre. The reflex is protective in nature and prevents the aspiration of food particles into respiratory passage. Aspiration pneumonia is an inflammation of lungs and bronchial tubes that occur after inhalation of any foreign matter. </p>


<p>It is also known as anaerobic pneumonia.</p>

<strong>Q.3. What is breaking point? Why is it caused?</strong>
   <p>Ans 3.The breaking point refers to the point at which breathing can no longer be voluntarily inhibited. It is due to the following reasons- Increased arterial pCO2 Increased arterial pO2</p>
   <strong>Q. 4. Why the person may feel dizzy after 15 to 30 seconds of hyperventilation?</strong>
   <p>Ans 4.When a person hyperventilates for 15-30 second and then steps and allows respiration to continue on its own, without exerting any control over it, there is a short period of apnea. This is followed by a few breaths and then a period of apnea once again, followed by a few breaths. The cycle may last for a while before returning to normal rhythm. The apnea is due to washing out of pCO2 (hypocapnia), but as CO 2 accumulates the breath starts again. Wash out carbon dioxide causes cerebral vasoconstriction and person may feel dizzy.</p>
