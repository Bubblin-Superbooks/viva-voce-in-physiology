   <strong>Q.10. Summation of muscle contraction is observed when the second stimulus falls on the late latent period but not on the early latent period of the first contraction. Explain why.</strong>
   <p>Ans 10. The tension resulting from the second stimulus applied successively at suitable interval is considered greater than that from the first stimulus. This phenomenon is known as the beneficial effect because the second stimulus gets benefitted by the changes produced in the muscle due to the first stimulus. The important reasons underlying this phenomenon are:- Release of more calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum Increase in the temperature of the muscle Decrease in the internal viscosity and resistance of the muscle [series elastic element being already stretched] Decrease in the inertia of the recording system.</p>
   <strong>Q.11. Is there any way of predicting the minimal tetanising freQ.cy of a muscle? Which is easier to tetanise- red or white skeletal muscle? Can smooth and cardiac muscles be tetanised too?</strong>
