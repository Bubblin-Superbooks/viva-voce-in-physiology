   <strong>Que.3. How do you distinguish a reticulocyte from an RBC and a reticulocyte from WBC in this experiment?</strong>
   <p>Ans. A reticulocyte :- Is a bit larger than the RBC. Contains a central core of RNA which takes up basic stain.</p>
   <strong>Que.4. What is the clinical significance of this experiment?</strong>
   <p>Ans. The reticulocyte count is done in the following situations:- To assess the red cell forming and releasing activity of the bone marrow. All conditions where high counts are expected e.g. hemolytic anemias.</p>
   <strong>Que.5. Why is the name of the cell as reticulocyte?</strong>
   <p>Ans. The reticulocytes [8Âµm in diameter] are juvenile RBCs. They contain large amounts of the remnants of the ribosomes and RNA. Chemically, the basophilic reticulum is RNA which is the remnant of the cytoplasm of the precursor cells.</p>
