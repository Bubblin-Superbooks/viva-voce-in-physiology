   <strong>Que.2. Tabulate the various changes in the blood indices in the different types of anemias.</strong>
   <p>Ans. The anemias are classified on the basis of changes in the values of Mean Corpuscular Volume [MCV] and Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration [MCHC].</p>

   <p>
   	Type of anemia findings: -
   	<ol>
   		<li>  Normocytic RBCs with normal MCV </li>
   		<li>  Macrocytic RBCs with MCV value more than the normal range. </li>
   		<li> Microcytic RBCs with MCV value less than the normal range. </li>
   		<li> Normochromic RBCs with normal MCHC value</li>


   	</ol>
   		</p>
   <p>RBCs whose MCHC value is below the normal range.</p>

      <strong>Que.3. Why MCHC cannot be greater than the normal value?</strong>
   <p>Ans. MCHC values never exceed 38% because RBCs cannot hold haemoglobin beyond its saturation point i.e. metabolic limit of the cells haemoglobin forming mechanism, therefore, anemia can never be hyperchromic.</p>
