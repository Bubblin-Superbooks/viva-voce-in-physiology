        Climate: Exposure to cold produces vasoconstriction and increases peripheral resistance via hypothalamus. Diastolic which is dependent on peripheral resistance primarily increases. Systolic blood pressures also increase.

         When one shakes hands with a person during winter, his hands are cold due to peripheral vasoconstriction. This is a mechanism to conserve heat loss from periphery. Vasoconstriction decrease blood supply and heat loss by convection and radiation to environment is decreased. Diurnal variation: Diurnal variation of 5-10 mmHg is common in Systolic Blood Pressure. Peak values of SBP are seen in afternoon and lowest during early hours of morning. Its reverse is observed in night workers as the diurnal rhythm is reversed.
