   <strong>Q.6. What are the conditions that hasten the onset of fatigue?</strong>
   <p>Ans. With subsequent stimulation of muscle preparation, the following changes occur:- Height of contraction decreases Relaxation is inadequate and incomplete Latent, contraction and relaxation periods increase in duration.</p>

   <h4>MEASURING THE SPEED OF NERVE CONDUCTION</h4>
   <strong>Q.1. Can a kymograph record bioelectric signals? Give reasons.</strong>
   <p>Ans 1. No the kymograph canâ€™t be used to record the bioelectric signals as it doesn't has an electric stimulator to record them.</p>
   <strong>Q.2. Which type of muscle contraction has been demonstrated- isotonic or isometric?</strong>
   <p>Ans 2. Isotonic type of contraction has been demonstrated in the experiment.</p>
