<p>Ans 11. The stimulation freQ.cy at which the summation of contraction will occur is determined by the contraction period duration. Eg. If the contraction period duration is 10 msec, freQ.cy only greater than 1/10 msec i.e. 100/sec will cause summation. White skeletal muscle fibres are easier to tetanise as they are fast conducting fibres.The smooth and cardiac muscles cannot be tetanised because in these muscles, the contractile response is greater than half over during the absolute refractory period [duration 180-200 msec], hence summation of contractile response is not possible.</p>
   <strong>Q.12. Are voluntary muscle contractions tetanic in nature?</strong>
   <p>Ans 12. Yes the voluntary muscle contractions are titanic in nature.</p>
   <strong>Q.13. Why is titanic contraction much greater in strength than a single twitch?</strong>
