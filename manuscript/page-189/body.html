Yes the summation of muscle contraction is associated with the summation of underlying electrical events because when the second stimulus is given, all the factors underlying the phenomenon of beneficial effects are already taken care of and hence the recorded response is stronger. Example:- If a skeletal muscle is given two successive stimuli of maximal strength, the response to the second stimulus depends upon how soon after the first stimulus it is given. The following results are obtained:- If the second stimulus falls during the latent period of the muscle, the arrival of the nerve impulse produces no additional response. The muscle is said to be completely refractory [non-responsive] If applied later, a second muscular response results, leading to further development of tension [summation of effects] irrespective of the phase of the muscle cycle in which the stimulus is applied.</p></div> </div>
