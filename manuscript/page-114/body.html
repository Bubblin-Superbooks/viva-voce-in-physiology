<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Diastolic which is dependent on peripheral resistance primarily increases. Systolic blood pressures also increase. When one shakes hands with a person during winter, his hands are cold due to peripheral vasoconstriction. This is a mechanism to conserve heat loss from periphery. Vasoconstriction decrease blood supply and heat loss by convection and radiation to environment is decreased. Diurnal variation: Diurnal variation of 5-10 mmHg is common in Systolic Blood Pressure. Peak values of SBP are seen in afternoon and lowest during early hours of morning. Its reverse is observed in night workers as the diurnal rhythm is reversed. Exercise: In untrained individual, in mild exercise the systolic blood pressure increases with decrease in diastolic blood pressure. In moderate exercise, both diastolic and systolic blood pressure increases. In severe exercise, there is a marked increase in systolic blood pressure and moderate increase in diastolic blood pressure.</p></div> </div>
