   <strong>Que.2. Tabulate the various changes in the blood indices in the different types of anemias.</strong>
   <p>Ans. The anemias are classified on the basis of changes in the values of Mean Corpuscular Volume [MCV] and Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration [MCHC]:- Type of anemia Findings 1.Normocytic RBCs with normal MCV 2.Macrocytic RBCs with MCV value more than the normal range. 3.Microcytic RBCs with MCV value less than the normal range. 4.Normochromic RBCs with normal MCHC value</p>
   <p>RBCs whose MCHC value is below the normal range.</p>
   <strong>Que.3. Why MCHC cannot be greater than the normal value?</strong>
   <p>Ans. MCHC values never exceed 38% because RBCs cannot hold haemoglobin beyond its saturation point i.e. metabolic limit of the cells haemoglobin forming mechanism, therefore, anemia can never be hyperchromic.</p>
