<strong> What are the other factors affecting fatigue? </strong>
<p>The other factors effecting fatigue are weight to be lifted, frequency of contractions, motivation, training, temperature of environment, blood supply to contracting muscles.</p>

   <strong>Q4. Why fatigue occurs earlier in arterial occlusion?</strong>
   <p>Ans 4. On raising the blood pressure to about 160-170 mmHg arterial blood flow to the arm is stopped. Fatigue sets in much earlier now because there is not only an accumulation of waste products in exercising muscle but also decreased oxygen supply and other nutrients.</p>
