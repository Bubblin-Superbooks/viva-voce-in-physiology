	<p>This is called Einthoven’s triangle. Thus, the Einthoven’s law states that in unipolar record, ECG records potential changes which affect the active electrode only. A record obtained in this method is labeled by letter “v” which means a vector. </p>

	<strong>Que.4. What information can you get from ECG?</strong>
   <p>Ans 4.ECG provides useful information about the following Heart rate, rhythm and conduction of cardiac muscle Position of heart in the chest, whether horizontal, oblique or vertical The relative size of cardiac chambers and cardiac muscle e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy Type of conduction block e.g. Left bundle or right bundle branch block Origin of new rhythm centers ( extra systole and arrhythmias) Site, duration and extent of ischemic damage to the myocardium e.g. coronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infraction Effect of electrolyte disturbances and of drugs.</p>
   
   <strong>Que.5. Classify main abnormalities of heart action and how are they reflected in ECG?</strong>
