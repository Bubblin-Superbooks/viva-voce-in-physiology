   <strong>Q.16. What are the possible sites of fatigue in a nerve muscle preparation? Is the nerve indefatigable? What is the first site of fatigue in these experiments?</strong>
   <p>Ans 16. The possible sites of fatigue are neuromuscular junction, synapse in the brain etc. Yes, the nerve is indefatigable. Usually the site of fatigue in these experiments is neuromuscular junction.</p>
   <strong>Q.17. What are the differences in after loading and free loading contractions? Give examples of these conditions in the human body.</strong>
