 Therefore, sudden standing increases diastolic blood pressure, if recorded within 30-60 seconds of change in posture after that it comes back to normal via the operation of baroreceptor reflex.</p>
 <p>
 Long term standing is a stressful situation and sympathetic activity increases. The heart rate, peripheral vasoconstriction to increase venous return occurs. Diastolic blood pressure increases in standing position as compared to sitting. It is lowest in lying posture. Shavasan or yog nidra is prescribed to hypertensives.</p>

   <strong>Que.2. How does heart rate and blood pressure vary with exercise and rest? What may be reason for this variation?</strong>
   <p>Ans. The heart rate and blood pressure increases in linearity with exercise due to the following reasons- Increase in sympathetic activity Decrease in vagal tone Increase in body temperature Release of catecholamines and thyroxine into circulation Change in blood chemistry e.g. hypoxia, hypercapnia and academia</p>
