<strong>Q.1 Define Electrocardiogram, Electrocardiography and Electrocardiograph.</strong>
   <p>Ans1. Electrocardiogram- The record of the electrical changes during the cardiac cycle is called Electrocardiogram (ECG) Electrocardiography-It refers to the basis of recording of ECG. The two methods are employed for its recoding-unipolar and bipolar. In unipolar method, ECG is recorded using one active exploring electrode while in bipolar method; ECG is recorded using two active exploring electrodes. Electrocardiograph-It refers to an instrument for making permanent record of small potential variations which occur in different parts of the body due to the electrical activity of the heart.</p>
   <strong>Q.2 Why is it necessary to have recording of 12 leads in electrocardiography? State the placement of electrodes in different lead systems.</strong>

   <p>Ans 2. The 12 leads in ECG can be compared to 12 men standing on 12 hill tops observing an event of spread of a forest fire. </p>
