<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>height ad width Irregular QRS complexes No “T” wave Ventricular tachycardia- QRS complexes are highly pleomorphic Undisturbed atrial activity is interspersed (scattered) with P waves without any relation to QRS complexes Ventricular flutter- ECG shows large oscillations –hair pin curves Main and terminal deflections can no longer be differentiated Ventricular fibrillations- ECG shows irregular, extremely fast slow potential fluctuations in rate, rhythm, amplitude and appearance Myocardial infarction- Elevation of ST segment in the leads overlying the area of infarct Depression of ST segment in the reciprocal leads Effects due to change in Ionic Composition of Blood Decrease in Na+ Concentration in ECG is associated with low voltage ECG Hyperkalemia QRS complex is prolonged and abnormal in appearance T wave is tall and peaked due to altered repolarization of myocardial cells Hypokalemia PR interval prolongation ST segment depression T wave inversion Prominent U wave Hypercalcemia Heart relax less in diastole and completely stops in systole</p></div> </div>
