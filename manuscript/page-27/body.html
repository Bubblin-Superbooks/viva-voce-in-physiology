   <strong>Que.5. What are the various sources of error in this experiment?</strong>
   <p>Ans. 1. Not bold enough prick to give free flowing of blood.</p>
   <ol>
      <li>Greasy and wet haemocytometer and cover slip.</li>
      <li>Wet pipette.</li>
      <li>A broken cover slip.</li>
      <li>Asymmetrical placement of cover slip.</li>

   <h4>BLOOD INDICES:-</h4>
   <strong>Que.1. What is the importance of determining the values of blood indices or knowing haemogram?</strong>
   <p>Ans.1. The basic values of Hb, RBC count and PCV do not give any information about the condition of an average red cell, such as its volume, Hb content, or its percentage saturation with Hb . This information in the form of absolute corpuscular values, can be calculated from 3 basic values of Hb, RBC count and PCV. Further, the basic rules found in a patient/subject can be compared with arbitrarily set ‘normal’ values.</p>
