	<p> Origin of new rhythm centers ( extra systole and arrhythmias) Site, duration and extent of ischemic damage to the myocardium e.g. coronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infraction Effect of electrolyte disturbances and of drugs</p>
   <strong>Que.5. Classify main abnormalities of heart action and how are they reflected in ECG?</strong>

   <p>Ans 5. The abnormalities in ECG are broadly of three types: Heart block. Origin of new rhythm centers–extrasystole and arrhythmias. Ischaemic myocardial disorders: angina and myocardial infarcts Heart Block Disturbance in normal transmission of impulses generated in “SAN” Prolongation of QRS complex (&gt;0.12seconds) with abnormal appearance Abnormal ST segment and T wave Split 2ND heart sound and normal heart rate New rhythm centres Extrasystole Atrial extrasystole Abnormal “P” wave followed by long PR interval Normal QRS complex “TP” interval is more than its normal vlue of 0.2 sec Ventricular extrasystole No “P” wave preceding QRS complex “QRS complex” is prolonged and abnormal in appearance Cardiac arrhythmias Atrial Tachycardia- All time intervals such as PR, TP are shortened T wave merges with P wave of next cardiac cycle Atrial flutter- </p>
