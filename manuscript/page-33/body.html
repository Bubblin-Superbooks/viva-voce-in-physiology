<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ans. Physiological variations:- Age:- Lowest value in new born because RBC count is more. Sex :- Higher value in females due to low RBCs count Pregnancy:- ESR increases as fibrinogen increases during pregnancy; this increases the rouleaux formation. Temperature :- ESR values are directly propotional to the temperature within the physiological limits. It acts by decreasing the blood viscosity. Pathological variations:- Increase in ESR is seen in condition which is associated with tissue damage or inflammation, the common conditions being: Anemia Any toxic or infective condition Malignancies Nephrosis as it is associated with increased fibrinogen, markedly decreased albumin and marked lipidemia which increases the globulin. Severe trauma Decrease in ESR value is found in: Polycythemia Leukemia Pernicious anemia Congestive heart failure Protein shock e.g. burns, dehydration Severe allergic reactions.</p></div> </div>
