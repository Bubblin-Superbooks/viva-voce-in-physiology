    <p> V1 to V4 are called anterior leads and they measure the electrical changes of right and left ventricles. V5 and V6 is referred to as the “left lateral leads.” </p>

    <h5> Unipolar recording: </h5>
    <p> In unipolar method, ECG is recorded using one active exploring electrode. In this two electrodes are used for recording purposes: one is the active exploring electrode, placed on the area of the body surface; and the other is indifferent electrode, which is kept at “zero potential” by connecting electrodes placed respectively on right arm (RA), left arm (LA) and left foot (LF) to a central terminal through 500 Ὼ resistance.</p>

    <strong>Que.3. State Einthoven’s law.</strong>
   <p>Ans 3.In a volume conductor, the sum of potentials at the points of an equilateral triangle with a equilateral triangle with a current source in the centre is zero at all times. A similar triangle can be approximated in our body by placing electrodes on RA, LA, and LF with current source as the heart at its centre.</p>
