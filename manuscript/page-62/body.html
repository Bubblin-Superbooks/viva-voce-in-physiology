Food intake and digestion- There is a mild increase which returns to normal within an hour or so. Physical exercise Mental stress Pregnancy- The count may be quite high, especially during the first pregnancy. Parturition- The high TLC is possibly due to tissue injury, pain, physical stress and hemorrhage.
