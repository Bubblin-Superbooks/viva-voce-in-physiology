Amebic hepatitis Malignancies- High counts are seen in half the cases; secondary infection enhances the count. Surgical operations- A post operative rise is seen in all cases. Physiological Leucopenia:- Exposure to extreme cold, even under arctic conditions and inspite of acclimatization, may reduce the count to only slightly below 4000/mm3 level. Pathological leucopenia:- Infection with non-pyogenic organisms- Typhoid and paratyphoid fever and sometimes in protozoal infection like malaria. Viral infections- Influenza, mumps, small pox, AIDS [Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome] Drugs- Chloramphenicol, sulphonamides, penicillin, cyclosporins, phenytoin etc. Cytotoxic drugs used in treating malignancies may also cause leucopenias by depressing the bone marrow [other blood cells may also decrease] Repeated exposures to X-rays and radium- These are used as radiotherapy in cancers and cause bone marrow depression.</p></div> </div>
