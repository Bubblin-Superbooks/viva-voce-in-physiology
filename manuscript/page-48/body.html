      	<p> Emotions: Excitement, fear, worry increase systolic blood pressure due to increase in cardiac couture secondary to increased sympathetic activity Gravity: The pressure in any vessel below heart level is increased and that above heart level is decreased due to the effect of gravity Hereditary: Familial tendencies of hypertension or hypotension of Systolic Blood pressure are common Meals: Changes in systemic Blood Pressure are seen due to- Pressure over heart due to distended abdomen increases “Heart rate” Increase epinephrine release from adrenal medulla (higher centre influence) </p></li>

 <h4>B. Effect of Posture and Exercise on Blood Pressure</h4>
   <strong>Que.1.How does the systolic and diastolic blood pressure change with posture? How would you explain these changes in time?</strong>
   <p>Ans.1. Upon standing, peripheral pooling of blood occurs in dependent parts, venous return decreases, cardiac out decreases and systolic blood pressure decreases by 6- 23 mm Hg. The baroreceptor discharge decreases to maintain homeostasis. The diastolic blood pressure decreases ia vasomotor centre.</p>
