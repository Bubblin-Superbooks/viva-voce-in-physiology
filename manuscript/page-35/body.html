   <strong>Que.1.Define Blood Pressure. What do the diastolic and systolic blood pressure depend upon?</strong>
   <p>ANS 1. The arterial Blood Pressure (B.P.) is defined as the lateral pressure exerted by a column of blood on the vessel wall while flowing through it. Systolic Blood Pressure It refers to the maximum pressure exerted during systole. It ranges from 100-140 mm Hg (Average 120 mmHg) Features It undergoes considerable fluctuations- Increased by excitement, exercise, meals etc Decreased by sleep, rest, meditation The systolic Blood Pressure indicates- Extent of work done by the heart or the force with which the heart is working and The degree of pressure which the arterial walls have to withstand Diastolic Blood Pressure It refers to the minimum pressure exerted during diastole. It ranges from 70-85 mmHg (Average -80 mmHg) Features It undergoes much less fluctuations It is the measure of total peripheral resistance It indicates the constant load against which heart has to work</p>
