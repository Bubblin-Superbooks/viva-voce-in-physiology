<p>Ans 13. The tetanic contraction is much greater than a single muscle twitch because it is produced by rapidly repeated maximal stimulation during the contraction phase and before any relaxation occurence, the individual responses fuse into one continuous contraction.</p>
   <strong>Q.14. Why is free loaded muscle contraction greater than an after loaded contraction even when the loads are equal? Is there an optimum load for a muscle?</strong>
   <p>Ans 14. This is because when a muscle fibre contracts, the tension is developed and hence the work output is propotional to the number of cross linkages between the actin and myosin molecules. So when the load is increased, the muscle is stretched further leading to a decrease in the number of cross linkages so that the work output decreases.</p>
   <strong>Q.15. Why does the contraction remainder occur in a fatigued muscle?</strong>
