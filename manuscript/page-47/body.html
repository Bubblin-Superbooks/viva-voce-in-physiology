         Exercise: In untrained individual, in mild exercise the systolic blood pressure increases with decrease in diastolic blood pressure. In moderate exercise, both diastolic and systolic blood pressure increases. In severe exercise, there is a marked increase in systolic blood pressure and moderate increase in diastolic blood pressure. BP=CO X PR. Systolic Blood pressure depends on Cardiac output (CO) that increases due to sympathetic activity with increasing intensity of exercise.

      	<p> Diastolic blood pressure increases with peripheral resistance (PR). The lumen size and PR, varies with opposing forces of sympathetic causing vasoconstriction and accumulation of local vasodilator metabolites during exercise like carbon dioxide, adenosine that causing vasodilation. This explains the variation of diastolic blood pressure in untrained individual with varying grades of exercise. In trained individuals the systolic blood pressure increases and diastolic blood pressu0re remains same. </p>
