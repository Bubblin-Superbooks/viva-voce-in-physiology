   <h4>ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE:-</h4>
   <strong>Que.1. Enumerate various factors that influence the process of sedimentation.</strong>
   <p>Ans. The factors affecting the sedimentation process are:- Rouleaux formation- by increasing density and decreasing the surface area increases the settling of RBCs. Viscosity of plasma:- if increases, settling decreases [viscosity of water: plasma: blood:: 1:3:5] Ratio of cells to plasma [normal- 45:55], if alters as in anemia, increases the rouleaux formation, hence settling of RBCs. Nature of anticoagulant used:- Liquid anticoagulants by altering cell-plasma ratio, increases the ESR.</p>
   <strong>Que.2. Why ESR reading is taken at the end of first hour?</strong>
   <p>Ans. It is due to the fact that during the first hour, more than 95% of cells settle down. The process of sedimentation takes place in three stages:-</p>
