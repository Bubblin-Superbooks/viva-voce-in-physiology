   <strong>Que.6. Does the presence of WBCs in the counting chamber affect the RBC count?</strong>
   <p>Ans. WBCs can be seen during the RBC count. They can be distinguished by their large size, uneven outline and halo around them. In humans, the ratio of RBCs:WBCs is 700:1. As the total number of RBCs counted in 5 medium-sized RBCs squares will be approximately 550, therefore hardly one WBC will come across in the field of counting. However, if counted, it will increase the RBC count by 10,000/ÂµL of blood [because multiplication factor is 10,000</p>
   <h4>ESTIMATION OF HAEMOGLOBIN:-</h4>
   <strong>Que.1. What is the normal range of values for haemoglobin?</strong>
   <p>Ans. The normal values of haemoglobin are as follows:- 
   		<ol> 
   			<li> At birth- 23gm/dL [more RBC]</li>
   			<li> At the end of 3 months- 10.5 gm/dL [as an infant is totally on milk feed which is devoid of iron].</li>
   			<li>At the end of 1 year- 12.5 gm/dL</li>

   		</ol>
