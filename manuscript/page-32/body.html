   <strong>Que.6. Why concentrated acid cannot be used in this method? Why haemoglobin has to be converted to another compound for colour estimation?</strong>
   <p>Ans. The concentrated acid cannot be used in this method because it will cause the destruction of protein present in the haemoglobin and thus interfere with its estimation. The hemoglobin has to be converted to acid hematin because if it is not converted to acid haematin by haemolysis, it will get the colour of oxyhaemoglobin which has a wide spectrum of colours and it is not possible to standardize the procedure.</p>
   <strong>Que.7. Why N/10 HCl is taken upto 2 gm% mark? What will happen to readings, if N/10 HCl is taken higher or lower than 2gm% mark?</strong>
   <p>Ans. If less acid is taken, the blood may not mix well and/or may clot. All the Hb will not be converted into acid hematin. This will result in false low value. </p>
