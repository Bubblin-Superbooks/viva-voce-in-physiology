   <strong>Q.3. Explain why most of the experiments employ maximal stimuli.</strong>
   <p>Ans. The use of maximal stimuli enables us to know if all the motor units have been simultaneously activated. Q.4. Does the skeletal muscle fibre obey All or None law? Explain. Ans. Yes, the skeletal muscle fibre obeys All or None Law but it is valid only if the environmental conditions like temperature and pH are constant.</p>
   <strong>Q.5 What are the causes for the latent period of a muscle twitch?</strong>
   <p>Ans 5. The latent period of a muscle twitch depends upon:- Conduction of impulse along the nerve Neuro muscular transmission Excitation-contraction coupling Stretching of series elements, especially tendons Inertia of the recording lever.</p>
   <strong>Q.6. Recording the contraction and relaxation periods of the muscle twitch helps in classifying the skeletal muscle. Explain.</strong>
