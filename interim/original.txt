### PART - I: AMPHIBIAN EXPERIMENTS 

Que.1 Define fatigue.
Ans. Fatigue is a temporary reduction of the working capacity of a cell, an organ or an organism as a whole resulting from prolonged exertion.
Que.2. What are the causes of fatigue? Is fatigue a reversible phenomenon?
Ans. The causes of fatigue are:-
Lack of nutrition
Accumulation of waste metabolites
Depletion of Ach stores
Fatigue is a reversible phenomenon and it passes off after rest.

Que.3. What is contraction remainder?
Ans. The baseline rises due to an incomplete relaxation of the muscle following the depletion of ATP, as a result of which the writing point does not come down to its original position and this is known as the contraction remainder.


Que.4 How do you prove that the muscle and the nerve are not the site of fatigue in the above experiment?
Ans. A) To prove that the muscle is not the site of fatigue, the muscle is stimulated directly after the fatigue sets in. It is seen that the muscle contracts vigorously.
B) To prove that the muscle is not the site of fatigue, two nerve muscle preparations are taken, then the nerves are crossed and a block of ice is kept over one of the nerve muscle preparation, thus preventing the nerve impulse transmission. Both the preparations are stimulated till fatigue sets in one of the preparations. Now remove the block of ice and stimulate the nerve, its muscle contracts proving that the nerve is not the site of fatigue.
Que.5. What is the first site of fatigue in an intact animal?
Ans. Neuromuscular Junction
Que.6. What are the conditions that hasten the onset of fatigue?
Ans. With subsequent stimulation of muscle preparation, the following changes occur:-
Height of contraction decreases
Relaxation is inadequate and incomplete
Latent, contraction and relaxation periods increase in duration.

MEASURING THE SPEED OF NERVE CONDUCTION
Que.1. Can a kymograph record bioelectric signals? Give reasons.
Ans. No the kymograph can’t be used to record the bioelectric signals as it doesn't has an electric stimulator to record them.
.2. Which type of muscle contraction has been demonstrated- isotonic or isometric?
Ans. Isotonic type of contraction has been demonstrated in the experiment.
Que.3. Explain why most of the experiments employ maximal stimuli.
Ans. The use of maximal stimuli enables us to know if all the motor units have been simultaneously activated.
Que.4. Does the skeletal muscle fibre obey All or None law? Explain.
Ans. Yes, the skeletal muscle fibre obeys All or None Law but it is valid only if the environmental conditions like temperature and pH are constant.
Que.5 What are the causes for the latent period of a muscle twitch?
Ans. The latent period of a muscle twitch depends upon:-
Conduction of impulse along the nerve
Neuro muscular transmission
Excitation-contraction coupling
Stretching of series elements, especially tendons
Inertia of the recording lever.
Que.6. Recording the contraction and relaxation periods of the muscle twitch helps in classifying the skeletal muscle. Explain.
Ans. The contraction and relaxation periods of the muscle twitch helps in classifying the skeletal muscle as:-
Isotonic muscle contraction
Isometric muscle contraction
Isotonic contraction
Isometric contraction
When the muscle shortens in length but the tension in the muscle remains constant.

When the muscle length is not affected but the tension in the muscle changes.

External work is done.

2.External work is not done.
Not much of heat is produced.

3.Greater amount of heat is produced.
It requires much sliding over of filaments actin-myosin.

4.It does not require much sliding over of the filaments.
LP,CP and RP are of shorter duration.

5.LP,CP and RP; all are of longer duration.

Que.7. Temperature affects isotonic and isometric contraction differently. Explain.
Ans. 1. Cold ringer solution decreases the temperature of the muscle, thereby increases the viscosity and retarding some metabolic processes.  Hence depolarisation is slow, thereby resulting in the decreased velocity of response.
Warm ringer solution increases the temperature of the muscle, thereby reducing its inertia and the synaptic delays are minimised.
Que.8. Which type of summation has been demonstrated to you: spatial or temporal?
Ans. Temporal summation 
Que.9. Is the summation of muscle contraction associated with the summation  underlying electrical events? Suggest an experiment that will give an answer to this question.
Ans. Yes the summation of muscle contraction is associated with the summation of underlying electrical events because when the second stimulus is given, all the factors underlying the phenomenon of beneficial effects are already taken care of and hence the recorded response is stronger.
Example:- If a skeletal muscle is given two successive stimuli of maximal strength, the response to the second stimulus depends upon how soon after the first stimulus it is given. The following results are obtained:-
If the second stimulus falls during the latent period of the muscle, the arrival of the nerve impulse produces no additional response. The muscle is said to be completely refractory [non-responsive]
If applied later, a second muscular response results, leading to further development of tension [summation of effects] irrespective of the phase of the muscle cycle in which the stimulus is applied.
Que.10. Summation of muscle contraction is observed when the second stimulus falls on the late latent period but not on the early latent period of the first contraction. Explain why.
Ans. The tension resulting from the second stimulus applied successively at suitable interval is considered greater than that from the first stimulus. This phenomenon is known as the beneficial effect because the second stimulus gets benefitted by the changes produced in the muscle due to the first stimulus. The important reasons underlying this phenomenon are:-
Release of more calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum
Increase in the temperature of the muscle
 Decrease in the internal viscosity and resistance of the muscle [series elastic element being already stretched]
Decrease in the inertia of the recording system.
Que.11. Is there any way of predicting the minimal tetanising frequency of a muscle? Which is easier to tetanise- red or white skeletal muscle? Can smooth and cardiac muscles be tetanised too?
Ans. The stimulation frequency at which the summation of contraction will occur is determined by the contraction period duration. Eg. If the contraction period duration is 10 msec, frequency only greater than 1/10 msec i.e. 100/sec will cause summation. White skeletal muscle fibres are easier to tetanise as they are fast conducting fibres.The smooth and cardiac muscles cannot be tetanised because in these muscles, the contractile response is greater than half over during the absolute refractory period [duration 180-200 msec], hence summation of contractile response is not possible.
Que.12.  Are voluntary muscle contractions tetanic in nature?
Ans. Yes the voluntary muscle contractions are titanic in nature.
Que.13. Why is titanic contraction much greater in strength than a single twitch?
Ans. The tetanic contraction is much greater than a single muscle twitch because it is produced by rapidly repeated maximal stimulation during the contraction phase and before any relaxation occurence, the individual responses fuse into one continuous contraction.
Que.14. Why is free loaded muscle contraction greater than an after loaded contraction even when the loads are equal? Is there an optimum load for a muscle?
Ans. This is because when a muscle fibre contracts, the tension is developed and hence the work output is propotional to the number of cross linkages between the actin and myosin molecules. So when the load is increased, the muscle is stretched further leading to a decrease in the number of cross linkages so that the work output decreases.
Que.15. Why does the contraction remainder occur in a fatigued muscle?
Ans. The contraction remainder occurs in the fatigue muscle as the baseline rises due to an incomplete relaxation of the muscle following the depletion of ATP.
Que.16. What are the possible sites of fatigue in a nerve muscle preparation? Is the nerve indefatigable? What is the first site of fatigue in these experiments?
Ans. The possible sites of fatigue are neuromuscular junction, synapse in the brain etc. Yes, the nerve is indefatigable. Usually the site of fatigue in these experiments is neuromuscular junction.
Que.17. What are the differences in after loading and free loading contractions? Give examples of these conditions in the human body.
Ans. 
After loading
Free loading
It is the condition in which the load starts acting on the muscle after the contraction has begun.

It is the condition in which the load acts on the muscle before it begins to contract.

The muscle is not stretched by the weight during rest.

2.It keeps the series elastic component of the muscle stretched.
It causes complete contraction of the contractile component.

3.It causes partial contraction of the contractile component.
The performance of the muscle is poor.

 4.The performance of the muscle is better.
e.g. movement of the skeletal muscle while lifting the weights
e.g. movement of skeletal muscle while carrying the weights.

Que.18. What is the effect of load on the latent period of the muscle twitch?
Ans. 1.The load lengthens the latent period but reduces the contraction and relaxation periods. 
2.It also reduces the height of the contraction so that the graph may be obtained on the drum.
3. It overcomes the inertia of the lever.
4. It makes the lever horizontal while keeping the muscle mildly stretched.
Que.19.. What is the relation between the optimum load and the tension developed in the muscle?
Ans. The optimum load and the tension developed in the muscle are directly propotional to each other.

Ans. The reticulocytes [8µm in diameter] are juvenile RBCs. They contain large amounts of the remnants of the ribosomes and RNA. Chemically, the basophilic reticulum is RNA which is the remnant of the cytoplasm of the precursor cells.
Que.6. What is vital, supravital staining? How does it differ from Leishman staining?
Ans. Vital staining is a special method of staining employed for unfixed,’living cells’ including tissue cultures. There are two types of vital staining:-

Ans. Late Normoblast [Late stage] of erythropoesis is reticulocyte.
 ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE:-

Que.1. Enumerate various factors that influence the process of sedimentation.
Ans. The factors affecting the sedimentation process are:-
Rouleaux  formation- by increasing density and decreasing the surface area increases the settling of RBCs.
Viscosity of plasma:- if increases, settling decreases [viscosity of water: plasma: blood:: 1:3:5]
Ratio of cells to plasma [normal- 45:55], if alters as in anemia, increases the rouleaux formation, hence settling of RBCs.
Nature of anticoagulant used:- Liquid anticoagulants by altering cell-plasma ratio, increases the ESR.
Que.2. Why ESR reading is taken at the end of first hour?
Ans. It is due to the fact that during the first hour, more than 95% of cells settle down. The process of sedimentation takes place in three stages:-

Stage 1 of about 10 min during which time rouleaux formation [piling of RBCs] occurs and aggregation occurs.
Stage 2 of approximately 40 min in which the sinking of the aggregates takes place at a constant speed.
Stage 3 of 10 min during which aggregated cells pack at the bottom of the tube.
Que3. Give the variations of ESR?
Ans. Physiological variations:-
Age:- Lowest value in new born because RBC count is more.
Sex :- Higher value in females due to low RBCs count
Pregnancy:- ESR increases as fibrinogen increases during pregnancy; this increases the rouleaux formation.
Temperature :- ESR values are directly propotional to the temperature within the physiological limits. It acts by decreasing the blood viscosity.
Pathological variations:-
Increase in ESR is seen in condition which is associated with tissue damage or inflammation, the common conditions being:
Anemia
Any toxic or infective condition
Malignancies
Nephrosis as it is associated with increased fibrinogen, markedly decreased albumin and marked lipidemia which increases the globulin.
Severe trauma
Decrease in ESR value is found in:
Polycythemia
Leukemia
Pernicious anemia
Congestive heart failure
Protein shock e.g. burns, dehydration
Severe allergic reactions.
Que4. What is the clinical significance of this experiment?
Ans. 1. ESR values have no diagnostic use, it has only prognostic value. E.g. if ESR increases, it indicates spread of some active disease process in the body.
2.ESR determination is useful in following the progress of patients suffering from chronic illness, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatism etc.




## PART - II Blood final viva


SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF BLOOD:-

Ans. Specific gravity is affected by:-
RBC count
Haemoglobin concentration
Plasma proteins
Water content
Que.3. What are the physiological and pathological conditions that affect the specific gravity of blood?
Ans. Physiological factors:- SG of blood is low in females, in the afternoon, pregnancy and after high water-intake. It is comparatively high in males and at night.
Pathological factors:- SG is high due to the loss of water such as vomiting and diarrhea.
DETERMINATION OF BLOOD GROUPS:-

Que.1. What is the importance of blood grouping?
Ans. Blood transfusion is a life saving procedure in all cases of severe loss of blood, and in life-threatening anemias. However blood can only be given after blood grouping which is an essential requirement before blood is given to any individual. Blood grouping is also done to settle paternity disputes and other medicolegal purposes.
Que.2. What is the use of control in this experiment?
Ans. RBC suspension [i.e. control] is used for the experiment to avoid false positive results due to rauleaux formation.
Que.3. What could be the possible errors while doing the experiment?

Ans.  1. Improper cleaning of slides with soap and water.
2. Improper labeling of the slides.
3. Intermixing of the four drops placed on the slide.
4. Examining the agglutination after drying up of solution.
5. Directly mixing of undiluted blood with antisera.
Que.4. What are the differences between coagulation, rauleaux formation and agglutination?
Ans. Coagulation:- It is the process by which blood changes from a liquid to a gel, forming a clot. It potentially results in hemostasis, the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel, followed by repair.
Rauleaux formation:-  It refers to the piling of the RBCs one over the other.
Agglutination:- It refers to the clumping of the RBCs. The phenomenon of agglutination is due to the interaction between the factors- antigen and antibody.
ARNETH COUNT:-
Que.1. What is Arneth count? What are their different stages?
Ans. Neutrophil count based on the lobes of its nucleus is called Arneth count. It indicates the state of development of neutrophils. The different stages are:-
N1- Stage 1: 5%
N2- Stage 2: 30%
N3- Stage 3: 45% [maximum in number; fully mature and functionally most efficient]
N4- Stage 4: 18%
N5$6- Stage 5: 2% [less motile, scanty granules, poorly stained, cells break up readily while making smear, functionally less active]
Que.2. What are the physiological factors and pathological conditions altering these counts?
Ans. Physiological causes:- Exercise, pregnancy, menstruation, lactation, in children [decrease in neutrophill count]
Pathological conditions:- After the injection of epinephrine, any pyogenic [pus forming] infection, following tissue destruction eg. burns, haemorrhage, after surgery etc, viral infections, bone marrow depression.
Que.3. What is the clinical significance of doing Arneth count?
Ans.3. Young neutrophils have fewer lobes as compared to the older cells which have 5 or 6 lobes. A higher percentage of younger or older cells in a blood film can provide useful information about the functional status of the bone marrow.
Que.4. What is Arneth curve?
Ans. It refers to the graph representation with neutrophil stages on the X-axis and their percentage on the Y-axis.
Total Leucocyte Count [TLC]:-
Que.1. Give the normal range of TLC.
Ans. The normal values of TLC are:-
After birth- 18,000/mm3-20,000/mm3
In adults- 4000/mm3-11,000/mm3 [average 7000/mm3]
Que.2. What is the clinical significance of this experiment?
Ans. The white blood corpuscles [WBCs; leucocytes] constitute the major defense system of the body against invasion by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins and other foreign invades. Their number increases or decreases in many diseases, particularly acute and chronic infections. This test is done as a part of CBC [Complete blood count] in cases of fever especially if the cause of fever is not immediately apparent.
Que.3. List the physiological and pathological variations in the number of WBCs.
Ans. Physiological leucocytosis:-
Normal infants- The count may be as high as 18,000-20,000/mm3 but it returns to normal values within 1-2 years.
Food intake and digestion- There is a mild increase which returns to normal within an hour or so.
Physical exercise
Mental stress
Pregnancy- The count may be quite high, especially during the first pregnancy.
Parturition- The high TLC is possibly due to tissue injury, pain, physical stress and hemorrhage.
Extremes of temperature- Exposure to sun, or to very low temperature can increase the WBC count.
Pathological leucocytosis:-
Acute infection with pyogenic [pus forming] bacteria
Myocardial infarction- The rise in TLC due to tissue injury is not seen immediately after a heart attack but only after 4-5 days.
Acute hemorrhage- Maximum response occurs in 8-10 hrs, the count returning to normal in 5-6 days.
Burns- Maximum response occurs in 5-15 hrs, the count returning to normal in 2-3 days.
Amebic hepatitis
Malignancies- High counts are seen in half the cases; secondary infection enhances the count.
Surgical operations- A post operative rise is seen in all cases.
Physiological Leucopenia:-
Exposure to extreme cold, even under arctic conditions and inspite of acclimatization, may reduce the count to only slightly below 4000/mm3 level.
Pathological leucopenia:-
Infection with non-pyogenic organisms- Typhoid and paratyphoid fever and sometimes in protozoal infection like malaria.
Viral infections- Influenza, mumps, small pox, AIDS [Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]
Drugs- Chloramphenicol, sulphonamides, penicillin, cyclosporins, phenytoin etc. Cytotoxic drugs used in treating malignancies may also cause leucopenias by depressing the bone marrow [other blood cells may also decrease]
Repeated exposures to X-rays and radium- These are used as radiotherapy in cancers and cause bone marrow depression.
Chemical poisons that depress bone marrow- Arsenic, dinitrophenol, antimony and others.
Malnutrition- Deficiency of vitamin B12 and folate, general malnutrition, starvation, extreme weakness and debility.
Hypoplasia and aplasia- Partial or complete depression of bone marrow i.e. failure of stem cells, may occur as a result of autoimmunity and other factors.
Preleukemic stages of leukemias.
Que.4. Define the terms leucocytosis, leucopenia and leukemia.
Ans. Leucocytosis:- It refers to an increase in the number of WBCs beyond 11,000/mm3 irrespective of the type of cells involved in raising TLC.
Leukopenia:- It refers to a decrease in the number of white cells [usually granulocytes] below the normal lower limit of 4,000/mm3
Leukemia:-  It refers to a group of malignant neoplasms of WBC forming organs- bone marrow and lymphoid tissue.
Que.5. What are the various sources of error in this experiment?

Ans.  1. Not bold enough prick to give free flowing of blood.
2. Greasy and wet haemocytometer and cover slip.
3. Wet pipette.
4. A broken cover slip.
5. Asymmetrical placement of cover slip.
6. Under or over-charging of the chamber.
BLOOD INDICES:-
Que.1. What is the importance of determining the values of blood indices or knowing haemogram?
Ans.1. The basic values of Hb, RBC count and PCV do not give any information about the condition of an average red cell, such as its volume, Hb content, or its percentage saturation with Hb . This information in the form of absolute corpuscular values, can be calculated from 3 basic values of Hb, RBC count and PCV. Further, the basic rules found in a patient/subject can be compared with arbitrarily set ‘normal’ values.
Que.2. Tabulate the various changes in the blood indices in the different types of anemias.
Ans. The anemias are classified on the basis of changes in the values of Mean Corpuscular Volume [MCV] and Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration [MCHC]:- 
Type of anemia
Findings
1.Normocytic
RBCs with normal MCV
2.Macrocytic
RBCs with MCV value more than the normal range.
3.Microcytic
RBCs with MCV value less than the normal range.
4.Normochromic
RBCs with normal MCHC value
       5. Hypochromic
RBCs whose MCHC value is below the normal range.
Que.3. Why MCHC cannot be greater than the normal value?
Ans. MCHC values never exceed 38% because RBCs cannot hold haemoglobin beyond its saturation point i.e. metabolic limit of the cells haemoglobin forming mechanism, therefore, anemia can never be hyperchromic.
RBC COUNT:-
Que.1. What is the normal RBC count?
Ans. The normal values of RBC count are:-
At birth- 6-7 million/µL
Adults- Males- 5-6 million/µL [average 5.5 million/µL]
              Females- 4.5-5.5 million/µL [average 4.8million/µL]
Que.2. What is the clinical importance? What are the conditions in which the RBC count decreases or increase?
Ans. Clinical importance:- It is taken as a part of complete blood count [CBC]. It can provide useful information in cases of anemia.
Increase in RBC count:-
Physiological causes-  new born, adult males, high altitude
Pathological causes- chronic hypoxia of bone marrow due to exercise or any cardiorespiratory disorders, polycythemia vera.
Decrease in RBC count:- 
Physiological causes- after birth [0-3 months], adult females
Pathological causes- all causes of anemia
Que.3. Why a dilution of 200 times is needed in the case of total RBC count?
Ans. A high dilution is needed because the number of RBCs is very high.
Que.4. What are the other uses of RBC pipette and Neubaure; chamber?


Ans. RBC pipette:-  i) Sperm count
                       ii) Platelets count
                      iii) WBC count [when WBCs increase tremendously as in leukemias]
Neubaure’s chamber:- Total Leucocyte Count [TLC]
Que.5. What are the various sources of error in this experiment?
Ans. This method is subjected to many errors, briefly these are;
Pipette error:-
Inaccuracy in the calibration
Inaccuracy in measuring the blood sample and the diluting fluid.
Field error:- Unequal distribution of cells over the grid caused by:-
Under or overcharging of the chamber.
Presence of grease on slide or cover slip.
Personal error:-  Counting fewer cells than are actually present [due to inexperience]
Statistical error:- It is inversely propotional to the square root of the number counted.
Que.6. Does the presence of WBCs in the counting chamber affect the RBC count?
Ans. WBCs can be seen during the RBC count. They can be distinguished by their large size, uneven outline and halo around them. In humans, the ratio of RBCs:WBCs is 700:1. As the total number of RBCs counted in 5 medium-sized RBCs squares will be approximately 550, therefore hardly one WBC will come across in the field of counting. However, if counted, it will increase the RBC count by 10,000/µL of blood [because multiplication factor is 10,000
 ESTIMATION OF HAEMOGLOBIN:-
Que.1. What is the normal range of values for haemoglobin?
Ans. The normal values of haemoglobin are as follows:-
At birth- 23gm/dL [more RBC]
At the end of 3 months- 10.5 gm/dL [as an infant is totally on milk feed which is devoid of iron].
At the end of 1 year- 12.5 gm/dL
Adults- i) Males- 14-18gm/dL [ average 15.5 gm/dL]
             ii) Females- 12-15.5 gm/dL [average 14.5gm/dL]
Que.2. What is the clinical importance of this experiment? Name the common conditions in which the Hb is high or low.

Ans. Clinical importance:-  The Hb concentration of blood is almost always estimated as part of routine laboratory investigation. The test is indicated as part of complete hematological study in all disorders of blood, especially in all types of anemias, leukemias, and in chronic diseases such as tuberculosis, chronic infections, malignancies, renal failure etc. and before all surgical operations.
Causes of increased Hb-
Physiological causes-  New born, adult males. High altitude
Pathological causes- chronic hypoxia of bone marrow due to exercise or any cardiorespiratory disorders, polycythemia vera.
Causes of decreased Hb-
Physiological causes- after birth [0-3 months], adult females
Pathological causes- all causes of anemia.
Que.3. Calculate  O2 carrying capacity of your blood. How does HbA differ from HbF? 
Ans. 1gm/dL haemoglobin, when fully saturated, combines with 1.34 ml of oxygen, therefore haemoglobin concentration is an index of oxygen carrying capacity of blood.
     Normal values:- Males- 21ml/dL
                                  Females- 18ml/dL
Adult Haemoglobin [HbA]
Fetal Haemoglobin [HbF]
1.Contains 4 polypeptide chains [2 alpha and 2 beta].
2. Appears in red cells of fetus in 5th month. At birth, 20% of total Hb is HbA.
3. Life span is long- 120 days.
4. It has usual affinity for oxygen.

5. Percentage saturation at pO2 of 20mmHg = 30-35%
1. The 2 beta chains are replaced by gamma chains.
2. HbF at birth makes up 80% of total Hb; disappears by 5th month after birth.
3. Life span is short- about 2 weeks.
4. It has greater affinity for oxygen as it binds 2,3 DPG less avidly.
5. Percentage saturation at pO2 of 20mmHg = 70%

Que.4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Sahli’s method?


Ans. Advantages:-  The advantage of using this method is its relative ease with which the brown colour of acid haematin can be compared with the comparator box standard colour optically, otherwise it is difficult to note the precision of the colour of acid haematin so formed.
Disadvantages:-  The disadvantage of this method is that it is tedious and time consuming to perform, especially with large number of samples. It is also not accurate as the relative marks on the haemoglobinometer are taken as standard ones and the hemoglobin is thus calculated with its help.
Que.5. Can N/10 HCl be used instead of distilled water for dilution and why?
Ans. Yes, N/10 HCl can be used for dilution instead of distilled water as the standard colour of acid haematin needed for comparison corresponds to the N/10 HCl.
Que.6. Why concentrated acid cannot be used in this method? Why haemoglobin has to be converted to another compound for colour estimation?
Ans. The concentrated acid cannot be used in this method because it will cause the destruction of protein present in the haemoglobin and thus interfere with its estimation. The hemoglobin has to be converted to acid hematin because if it is not converted to acid haematin by haemolysis, it will get the colour of oxyhaemoglobin which has a wide spectrum of colours and it is not possible to standardize the procedure.
Que.7. Why N/10 HCl is taken upto 2 gm% mark? What will happen to readings, if N/10 HCl is taken higher or lower than 2gm% mark?
Ans. If less acid is taken, the blood may not mix well and/or may clot. All the Hb will not be converted into acid hematin. This will result in false low value. If much more acid is taken, the final color developed in case of anemia would be much lighter than the standard. Color matching will then not be possible, because the color of the solution cannot be concentrated.
Que.8. Why distilled water and not tap water is used for dilution?
Ans. The tap water cannot be used because its salt content may cause turbidity which will interfere with color matching.
