If the contraction period duration is 10 msec, frequency only greater than 1/10 msec i.e. 100/sec will cause summation. White skeletal muscle fibres are easier to tetanise as they are fast conducting fibres.The smooth and cardiac muscles cannot be tetanised because in these muscles, the contractile response is greater than half over during the absolute refractory period [duration 180-200 msec], hence summation of contractile response is not possible.</p></div> </div>
