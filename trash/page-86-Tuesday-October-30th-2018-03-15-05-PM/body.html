<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ans. This method is subjected to many errors, briefly these are; Pipette error:- Inaccuracy in the calibration Inaccuracy in measuring the blood sample and the diluting fluid. Field error:- Unequal distribution of cells over the grid caused by:- Under or overcharging of the chamber. Presence of grease on slide or cover slip. Personal error:- Counting fewer cells than are actually present [due to inexperience] Statistical error:- It is inversely propotional to the square root of the number counted.</p><p>######Que.6. Does the presence of WBCs in the counting chamber affect the RBC count?</p><p>Ans. WBCs can be seen during the RBC count. They can be distinguished by their large size, uneven outline and halo around them. In humans, the ratio of RBCs:WBCs is 700:1. As the total number of RBCs counted in 5 medium-sized RBCs squares will be approximately 550, therefore hardly one WBC will come across in the field of counting.</p></div> </div>
