It the electrical activity is towards a electrode a positive wave is recorded and if the electrical activity moves away from the electrode a negative wave is recorded. V1 and V2 reflect right ventricular activity and the initial portion of the QRS complex is a small upward deflection followed by a large “ S “ wave i.e. main QRS deflection in V1 and V2 is negative V3 and V4 reflect activity of both the ventricles including Interventricular septum activity and there may be initial small PQ wave followed by moderate R and S wave i.e. QRS deflection in V3 and V4 is biphasic V5 and V6 reflect left ventricular activity; initially there is a small Q wave followed by large R wave i.e. the main QRS deflection in V5 and V6 is positive.</p></div> </div>
