V1 and V2 face the right ventricle, V 3 and V4 over the interventricular septum and V5 and V6 over the left ventricle. V1 to V4 are called anterior leads and they measure the electrical changes of right and left ventricles. V5 and V6 is referred to as the “left lateral leads” Unipolar recording In unipolar method, ECG is recorded using one active exploring electrode. In this two electrodes are used for recording purposes: one is the active exploring electrode, placed on the area of the body surface; and the other is indifferent electrode, which is kept at “zero potential” by connecting electrodes placed respectively on right arm (RA), left arm (LA) and left foot (LF) to a central terminal through 500 Ὼ resistance.</p></div> </div>
