A similar triangle can be approximated in our body by placing electrodes on RA, LA, and LF with current source as the heart at its centre. This is called Einthoven’s triangle. Thus, the Einthoven’s law states that in unipolar record, ECG records potential changes which affect the active electrode only. A record obtained in this method is labeled by letter “v” which means a vector. ue.4Stat</p></div> </div>
