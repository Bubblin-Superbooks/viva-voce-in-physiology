<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ans 5. The latent period of a muscle twitch depends upon:- Conduction of impulse along the nerve Neuro muscular transmission Excitation-contraction coupling Stretching of series elements, especially tendons Inertia of the recording lever.</p><p>######Que.6. Recording the contraction and relaxation periods of the muscle twitch helps in classifying the skeletal muscle. Explain.</p><p>Ans 6. The contraction and relaxation periods of the muscle twitch helps in classifying the skeletal muscle as:- Isotonic muscle contraction Isometric muscle contraction Isotonic contraction Isometric contraction When the muscle shortens in length but the tension in the muscle remains constant.</p><p>When the muscle length is not affected but the tension in the muscle changes.</p></div> </div>
