In man the first site of fatigue is the “synapse in the brain” In amphibians, the neuromuscular junction seems to be the first site of fatigue. This cn be shown indirectly as follows- To prove the muscle is not the site of fatigue, the muscle is stimulated directly after fatigue sets in. It is seen that the muscle contracts vigorously. To prove the nerve is not the site of fatigue, the two nerve muscle preparations are crossed and a block of ice kept over one of it, it prevents the transmission of nerve impulse.</p></div> </div>
