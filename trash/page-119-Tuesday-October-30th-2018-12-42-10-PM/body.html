Upon standing, peripheral pooling of blood occurs in dependent parts, venous return decreases, cardiac out decreases and systolic blood pressure decreases by 6- 23 mm Hg. The baroreceptor discharge decreases to maintain homeostasis. The diastolic blood pressure decreases ia vasomotor centre. Therefore, sudden standing increases diastolic blood pressure, if recorded within 30-60 seconds of change in posture after that it comes back to normal via the operation of baroreceptor reflex. Long term standing is a stressful situation and sympathetic activity increases. The heart rate, peripheral vasoconstriction to increase venous return occurs. Diastolic blood pressure increases in standing position as compared to sitting. It is lowest in lying posture. Shavasan or yog nidra is prescribed to hypertensives.</p></div> </div>
