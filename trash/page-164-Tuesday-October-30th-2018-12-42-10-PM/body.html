<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ans 4.When a person hyperventilates for 15-30 second and then steps and allows respiration to continue on its own, without exerting any control over it, there is a short period of apnea. This is followed by a few breaths and then a period of apnea once again, followed by a few breaths. The cycle may last for a while before returning to normal rhythm. The apnea is due to washing out of pCO2 (hypocapnia), but as CO 2 accumulates the breath starts again. Wash out carbon dioxide causes cerebral vasoconstriction and person may feel dizzy.</p></div> </div>
