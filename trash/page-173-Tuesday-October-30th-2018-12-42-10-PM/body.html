It is seen that the muscle contracts vigorously. B) To prove that the muscle is not the site of fatigue, two nerve muscle preparations are taken, then the nerves are crossed and a block of ice is kept over one of the nerve muscle preparation, thus preventing the nerve impulse transmission. Both the preparations are stimulated till fatigue sets in one of the preparations. Now remove the block of ice and stimulate the nerve, its muscle contracts proving that the nerve is not the site of fatigue.</p></div> </div>
