<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ans. 7. Cold ringer solution decreases the temperature of the muscle, thereby increases the viscosity and retarding some metabolic processes. Hence depolarisation is slow, thereby resulting in the decreased velocity of response. Warm ringer solution increases the temperature of the muscle, thereby reducing its inertia and the synaptic delays are minimised.</p><p>######Que.8.
